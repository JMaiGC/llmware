Wheel Archives: `llmware` pip install from pypy 
===============

How to use?

1.  Download a selected wheel, unzip, and then deploy the code directly into a project.
2.  Place the wheel archive in a folder, and in that folder path, run:

```pip3 install llmware-0.1.14-py3-none-any.whl```  

New wheels are built generally on PyPy on a weekly basis and updated on PyPy versioning.   The development repo is updated  
and current at all times, but may have updates that are not yet in the PyPy wheel.

All wheels are built and tested on five platforms:

1.  Mac Metal
2.  Mac x86
3.  Windows x86
4.  Linux x86
5.  Linx aarch64
